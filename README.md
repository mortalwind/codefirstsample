# CodeFirstSample

Hello everyone,

This project is a sample of the <strong>Code-First</strong> approach for database creation strategy.

Code-First is mainly useful in Domain Driven Design.

<strong>About this project</strong>

You can imagine that you've got a web application that lists your books and their authors.  Maybe you're a bookseller :)
  
And this application lists your books with prices. You can get about of book details. 

<strong>How does it work?</strong>

This project is very simple. It shows how can use EF Core Code-First approach in Docker container.

Requirements:
  
- You should have Docker Desktop on your PC.
  
- Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, or a similar application must be installed on your PC.
  
- You better know Git commands.
  
- You should know C#, you better know Dockerfile and docker-compose commands.
  
If you don't know Docker containers and their command, it's no problem, I'll explain below.

<strong>Let's start!</strong>

Open your Command Prompt,Terminal or Powershell then go to your projects directory.
Type <code>git clone https://github.com/mortalwind/samplemicroservices.git</code> code, press Enter.
Wait while Git is cloning the project in your project directory. 

Change your directory with this code: <code> cd .\CodeFirstSample\</code> .
And you can edit it with VS Code using this code <code>code run -r </code>
Or you can open it in your editor directly.
